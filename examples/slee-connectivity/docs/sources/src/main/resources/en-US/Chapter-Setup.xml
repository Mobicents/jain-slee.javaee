			<para>The example in this user guide requires that &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE is properly set. In case you are using separated JVMs to host the Java EE and JAIN SLEE applications, the &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE Remote SLEE Connection Tool must be deployed in the Java EE server. The remote connection tool must be properly configured so that it can interact with the remote JAIN SLEE container.</para>

				    <para>Use Git to checkout a specific release source. The Git repository URL is located at https://code.google.com/p/jain-slee.javaee/ . For example, if the release version is  &THIS.VERSION;, you will proceed as follows:</para>
				    <programlisting>
				    [usr]$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/jain-slee.javaee mobicents-jain-slee-javaee
				    [usr]$ cd mobicents-jain-slee-javaee
				    [usr]$ git checkout tags/&THIS.VERSION;
